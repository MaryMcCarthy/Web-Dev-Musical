        <p>This site is about musicals, it is there to give details about about certain musicals and also to give you a taster of the
            types of songs with in a musical of your choice. It gives you the opportunity to learn about the musical at its basics form so no spoilers 
            but also allows you to listen to 8 songs from the original sound tracks of the music.
            
            Overall I am quite happy with the way my page turned out. If I had had more time I would have added more buttons for it to be more interactive.
            I also would have added to the the colour scheme had I had more time to toggle with the colours, I would have added in more about the actors in the 
            musicals too. However I am very happy with the amount of picture I got done in the given time space though bar the index page the linked pages are all very similar
            in style which made it a lot easier. I did have the two other pictures and pages done but the file was too big then if I had had more space it'd have been better.

            In reference to where I copied things from;
            1. I learned about the audio tag from W3schools.

            2.I got help for the descriptions of some harder musicals through wikipedia and musical websites such as broadways own website.

            3. I sourced all my music from youtube and googled some of the songs I didnt know the name of in musicals.

            4. I sourced pictures from google images.
