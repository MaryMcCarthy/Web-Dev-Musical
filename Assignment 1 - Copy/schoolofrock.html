<h5>School of Rock, The Musical</h>
<p>Based on the film of the with Jack Black, School of Rockâ€”The Musical tells the story of wannabe rock star Dewey Finn, who pretends to be substitute teacher at a prep school.
 When he discovers his students' musical talents, he enlists his fifth-graders to form a rock group and conquer the Battle of the Bands. This is a delightful musical filled with 
strong children performers who allow us to feel the tension and urgency within the musical. The songs, while not always the best, are fun and also humorous.</p>
